  "body": "This theme was designed basically showing code and text.\r\nImages are only a support and not the primary content.\r\n\r\n - Example of use: http://www.emm-gfx.net\r\n - WordPress directory: https://wordpress.org/themes/material-for-coders/\r\n - Portfolio plugin: https://github.com/emmgfx/emm-portfolio\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to install\r\n\r\n~~Only download this repo by clicking the __Download ZIP__ button on the Github sidebar. Unzip it and rename the folder to only \"__material-for-coders__\" (remove the \"__-master__\" word that Github appends automatically). It works well if you don't rename it, but the update system may cause problems, so, **do it**.~~\r\n\r\nEven though you can install by downloading the GitHub zip and installing it manually in your WordPress, since the 2.0.2 I recommend to use the WordPress installer. You can go to your _wp-admin_ and search for \"Material for Coders\" in the themes directory.\r\n\r\n### Updates\r\n\r\n~~The theme counts with an auto updater, basically sync your theme with this repo. You only have to enter on the theme settings page and follow the link to update. Wordpress validation system is too slow and I preferred to made the update system on my own. You can check the few lines refered to the updates on the [updater.php file](https://github.com/emmgfx/material-for-coders/blob/master/includes/updater.php).~~\r\n\r\nSince 2.0.2 the theme has deleted the support to update against the GitHub repository. Now it uses only the official WordPress themes directory updater and you can install and update through the WordPress admin panel.\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\n\r\nNow available in **English**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Brazilian Portuguese**.\r\n\r\nSo, covering the 40,3% of the internet. (Using the [Internet World Stats data](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm))\r\n\r\n### Portfolio\r\n\r\nThis theme is preppared to use the [emm-portfolio plugin](https://github.com/emmgfx/emm-portfolio). Note that this plugin isn't even available through the official WordPress directory, but you can download and install equally.\r\n\r\nYou can create projects through the admin panel. Only need to create a new page\r\nwith the **Portfolio Index** theme, and that's all. This page shows your\r\nportfolio projects. Remember to add it to your menu.\r\n\r\n### Coming soon\r\n\r\n* **More languages**: If you want to translate, check out the .po files in the\r\nlanguages folder, you can translate it with the Poedit software.\r\n* **Home page**: With new widgets to create a home page with latest projects, and/or\r\nlatests posts, etc. Some idea about this? create a issue with the suggestion.\r\n\r\n### Collaborate\r\n\r\nFeel free to collaborate by improving whatever. If you think that anything isn't\r\nworking properly you can open an issue or correct it and do a pull request.\r\n",
