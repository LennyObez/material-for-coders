# material-for-coders
Wordpress theme

This theme was designed basically showing code and text.
Images are only a support and not the primary content.

Example of use: http://www.emm-gfx.net

### How to install

Only download this repo by clicking the __Download ZIP__ button on the Github sidebar. Unzip it and rename the folder to only "__material-for-coders__" (remove the "__-master__" word that Github appends automatically). It works well if you don't rename it, but the update system may cause problems, so, **do it**.

### Updates

The theme counts with an auto updater, basically sync your theme with this repo. You only have to enter on the theme settings page and follow the link to update. Wordpress validation system is too slow and I preferred to made the update system on my own. You can check the few lines refered to the updates on the [updater.php file](https://github.com/emmgfx/material-for-coders/blob/master/includes/updater.php).

### Languages

Now available in **English**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Brazilian Portuguese**.

So, covering the 34,4% of the internet. (Using the [Internet World Stats data](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm))

### Portfolio

You can create projects through the admin panel. Only need to create a new page
with the **Portfolio Index** theme, and that's all. This page shows your
portfolio projects. Remember to add it to your menu.

### Coming soon

* **More languages**: If you want to translate, check out the .po files in the
languages folder, you can translate it with the Poedit software.
* **Home page**: With new widgets to create a home page with latest projects, and/or
latests posts, etc. Some idea about this? create a issue with the suggestion.
