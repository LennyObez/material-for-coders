# material-for-coders
Wordpress theme

This theme was designed basically showing code and text.
Images are only a support and not the primary content.

Example of use: http://www.emm-gfx.net

### How to install

Only download this repo by clicking the __Download ZIP__ button on the Github sidebar. Unzip it and rename the folder to only "__material-for-coders__" (remove the "__-master__" word that Github appends automatically). It works well if you don't rename it, but the update system may cause problems, so, **do it**.

### Updates

The theme counts with an auto updater, basically sync your theme with this repo. You only have to enter on the theme settings page and follow the link to update. Wordpress validation system is too slow and I preferred to made the update system on my own. You can check the few lines refered to the updates on the [updater.php file](https://github.com/emmgfx/material-for-coders/blob/master/includes/updater.php).

### Portfolio

You can create projects through the admin panel. Only need to create a new page
with the **Portfolio Index** theme, and that's all. This page shows your
portfolio projects. Remember to add it to your menu.

### Coming soon

 * Better Bootstrap integration.
 * I will implement a clean way to for manage (in the source code, not in the admin) multiple color schemes with the minimum headaches and using only one stylesheet (thinking on this Sitepoint article: http://www.sitepoint.com/dealing-color-schemes-sass/).

### Collaborate

Feel free to collaborate by improving whatever. If you think that anything isn't
working properly you can open an issue or correct it and do a pull request.
