Wordpress theme

This theme was designed basically showing code and text.
Images are only a support and not the primary content.

Example of use: http://www.emm-gfx.net

The theme counts with an auto updater, basically sync your theme with this repo. You only have to enter on the theme settings page and follow the link to update. Wordpress validation system is too slow and I preferred to made the update system on my own. You can check the few lines refered to the updates on the [functions.php file](https://github.com/emmgfx/material-for-coders/blob/master/functions.php).

Soon will integrate a system of own portfolio, made for programmers, not for designers (like the rest).

Feel free to collaborate by improving whatever.
