# material-for-coders
Wordpress theme

This theme was designed basically showing code and text.
Images are only a support and not the primary content.

Example of use: http://www.emm-gfx.net

### How to install

Only download this repo by clicking the __Download ZIP__ button on the Github sidebar. Unzip it and rename the folder to only "__material-for-coders__" (remove the "__-master__" word that Github appends automatically). It works well if you don't rename it, but the update system may cause problems, so, do it.

### Updates

The theme counts with an auto updater, basically sync your theme with this repo. You only have to enter on the theme settings page and follow the link to update. Wordpress validation system is too slow and I preferred to made the update system on my own. You can check the few lines refered to the updates on the [functions.php file](https://github.com/emmgfx/material-for-coders/blob/master/functions.php).

### Coming soon

Soon will integrate a system of own portfolio, made for programmers, not for designers (like the rest).

Feel free to collaborate by improving whatever.
